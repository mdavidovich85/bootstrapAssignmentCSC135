        <td>I love to cook.  I started baking as a child and watched plenty of Food Network in middle-school and high school.
        In college I started getting more creative about cooking, but it wasn't until I graduated that I learned more about nutrition and
        buying and cooking good, wholesome food.  I subscribe to Food & Wine magazine and currently enjoy learning new recipes from New Your Times Cooking.</td>

        <td>My father died from cancer and I truly believe that his life could have been better if he had simply taken better
        care of himself through fitness and exercise.  As a former "fat kid," as well, I've always been sensitive about my weight
        but always remind myself that working out is for my health and not to achieve an unachievable body.  I enjoy weight lifting, biking,
        tennis, and indoor rock climbing.  I'm currently a member of Lifetime Fitness.</td>

        <td>I inherited my father's model train one day when he decided to take it to the flea market to sell.  Never having seen it before, I begged 
        to keep it and start my own hobby.  It's unfortunately a very expensive hobby, so my progress with it has been limited.  As I invest in and complete
        school, I will have to put this hobby on hold for the time being.  I model in O Scale.</td>

        at my annual Christmas party!  I enjoy jazz piano, but I'm not a good improvisor.  One can only wish.  </td>
